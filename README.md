# Population-Prediction
This repository holds the data gathering, preparation, and machine learning code to predict population changes based on local weather attributes. Population data was gathered from the Living Planet Index, and weather attributes come from NOAA's API. The three primary scripts are Data_gathering.py, make_labels.py and ML2.ipynb. First, Data_gathering.py identifies the locations in which the population studies took place and grabs GSOY weather data for the location during the years of the study. This data is connected to the corresponding population data. Next, make_labels.py creates usable datasets for machine learning from the population and weather data that has been collected. The Jupyter Notebook ML2.ipynb takes in the dataframe created by make_labels, and formats the data for classification or regression algorithms. After preliminary data preparation, the notebook is designed to look at the implementation of a decision tree classificer, a random forest classifier, and a linear regression model from sklearn. A comparison of the impact of tuning various hyperparameters is made for each of the models.
